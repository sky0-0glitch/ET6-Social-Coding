🚀 **Bridging Math and Programming – Code Challenge**


Welcome to the Bridging Math and Programming Code Challenge! This challenge is designed to help you apply discrete mathematics concepts to real-world programming problems using Python.


📌 **General Information** 

* **Date:** Tuesday, February 4, 2025

* **Time:** 12:00 PM – 1:30 PM EST

* **Format:** Participants will be divided into groups and assigned to breakout rooms for collaboration.

* **Challenges:** The repository includes four programming challenges based on Boolean algebra, set theory, and number systems. Each problem comes with a real-world scenario explained within the corresponding challenges1-4.py files.
* **Problem 4:** This is optional and can be attempted if time allows.

📜 **Rules & Guidelines** 

❌ **What is NOT Allowed?**

❌ No AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot, or other AI-powered coding assistants).

❌ No external online solutions (e.g., Stack Overflow, coding forums).

✅ **What is Allowed?**

✅ Your notes & PowerPoint slides from previous sessions.

✅ Python’s official documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/

✅ Collaboration with your group – Discuss, brainstorm, and solve problems together!

👥 **Teamwork & Breakout Rooms** 

* Participants will be divided into groups.

 * Each group can select a team name.

* Each team must write their team name and member names as a comment or group description in their repository.

* Each group will work in a breakout room to solve the problems collaboratively.

* Real-world scenarios are explained under challenges/challenge1-4.py.

* Problem #4 is optional—if time allows, groups can attempt it.

⏳**Time Managemen**

* The challenge is 60 minutes long.

* Aim to complete at least the first three problems before moving to the fourth.

🏆 **Code Submission & Peer Review**

* After the coding challenge, each group's code will be assigned to another group for peer review.

* The reviewing group will evaluate the code using the MIT Emerging Talent Code Review Checklist.

* Feedback should be constructive and specific, focusing on:

* Functionality & correctness (Does it work as expected?)

* Readability & structure (Is the code well-organized and understandable?)

* Mathematical & logical accuracy (Are calculations correct?)

* Edge cases & input handling (Does it handle unexpected inputs?)

* Python best practices (PEP 8, clean coding principles)
